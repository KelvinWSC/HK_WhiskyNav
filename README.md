## **Background**
A 3-week capstone project utilizing Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Web Scraping, Recommendation System, Natural Language Processing and Data Visualization.
<br><br />

## **Description**
HK WhiskyNav uses Machine Learning to provide whisky identification, selling info consolidation, flavour analysis and recommendation services in one go.
User can upload a photo or image of a whisky bottle, the app then applies Deep Learning technology to distinguish 100 different popular whiskies found in HK and identify the correct brand and year.

After identification, the app then consolidates related information in real time, including price range, name and address of all available shops in HK.

Furthermore, through Machine Learning, the app can analyse the flavour profile of the whisky and display an easy-to-understand flavour description to the user.
Through the anaylsis of the flavour profile, the app can also accurately recommend similar whisky, or completely different whisky for user to explore.
